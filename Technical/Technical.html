           Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[17] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
          </p>
          <p>
           Java gained popularity shortly after its release, and has been a very popular programming language since then
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses.
            </li>
            <li>
             Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.) It is one of the most popular programming language in the world It has a large demand in the current job market It is easy to learn and simple to use It is open-source and free

          <p>To check if you have Java installed on a Windows PC, search in the start bar for Java or type the following in Command Prompt (cmd.exe):</p>

          <ul>
            <li>
             If Java is installed, you will see something like this (depending on version):
            </li>
            <code>
              java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
              Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
              Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
            </code>
            <li>If you do not have Java installed on your computer, you can download it for free at oracle.com.</li>
            <li>
             In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename. Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like Notepad). The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code:
            </li>
          </ul>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Syntax">
        <header>Java Syntax</header>
        <article>
          <p>
         In the previous chapter, we created a Java file called Main.java, and we used the following code to print "Hello World" to the screen:
          </p>
           <code>
            public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
             System.out.println("Hello World");
              }
            }
          </code>

          <p>
          Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
          Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.
          The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename. To run the example above on your computer, make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to the Get Started Chapter for how to install Java. The output should be:
          </p>
          <code>
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello World");
             }
          </code>

          You learned from the previous chapter that you can use the println() method to output values or print text in Java:
          <code>
          System.out.println("Hello World!");
          </code>

       You can add as many println() methods as you want. Note that it will add a new line for each method:

      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Variables">
        <header>Java Variables</header>
        <p>
       Variables are containers for storing data values.
      In Java, there are different types of variables, for example:
      
      <ul>
        <li> <strong> String </strong> - stores text, such as "Hello". String values are surrounded by double quotes
        </li>
        <li> <strong> int </strong> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
        </li>
        <li> <strong> float </strong> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
        </li>
        <li> <strong> char </strong> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
        </li>
        <li> <strong>boolean </strong>- stores values with two states: true or false
        </li>
      </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
       To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
        </p>
        <code>
          type variableName = value;
        </code>
        <p>
       Where type is one of Java's types (such as int or String), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or name). The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable
       To create a variable that should store text, look at the following example:
        </p>
        <code>
          String name = "John";
          System.out.println(name);
        </code>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Java_DataTypes">
        <header>Java DataTypes</header>
        <article>
        As explained in the previous chapter, a variable in Java must be a specified data type:
         <code>
           int myNum = 5;               // Integer (whole number)
           float myFloatNum = 5.99f;    // Floating point number
           char myLetter = 'D';         // Character
           boolean myBool = true;       // Boolean
           String myText = "Hello";     // String
         </code>
          <p>
           The char data type is used to store a single character. The character must be surrounded by single quotes, like 'A' or 'c':
          </p>
          <code>
            char myVar1 = 65, myVar2 = 66, myVar3 = 67;
            System.out.println(myVar1);
            System.out.println(myVar2);
            System.out.println(myVar3);
          </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Type_Casting">
        <header>Type Casting</header>
        <article>
          <p>
          Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
          In Java, there are two types of casting:
          <ul>
            <li> <strong> Widening Casting </strong> (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double    </li>
            <li> <strong> Narrowing Casting </strong>  (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size typedouble -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte</li>
          </ul>
          </p>

          <p>
            Widening Casting
          </p>
          <code>
            public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
            int myInt = 9;
            double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double

            System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
            System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.0
           }
          }
          </code>
          <p>
          Narrowing Casting
          </p>

          <code>
           public class Main {
           public static void main(String[] args) {
           double myDouble = 9.78d;
           int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int

           System.out.println(myDouble);   // Outputs 9.78
           System.out.println(myInt);      // Outputs 9
          }
         }
          </code>

        <header>Java Operators</header>
        <article>
          <p>
         Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
         In the example below, we use the + operator to add together two values:
          </p>
          <code>
            int x = 100 + 50;
          </code>

          <p>
           Although the + operator is often used to add together two values, like in the example above, it can also be used to add together a variable and a value, or a variable and another variable:
          </p>
          <code>
            int sum1 = 100 + 50;        // 150 (100 + 50)
            int sum2 = sum1 + 250;      // 400 (150 + 250)
            int sum3 = sum2 + sum2;     // 800 (400 + 400)
          </code>
        </article>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Strings">
        <header>Java Strings</header>
        <article>
          <p>
        Strings are used for storing text. A String variable contains a collection of characters surrounded by double quotes:
          </p>
          <code>
            String greeting = "Hello";
          </code>
          <p>
          A String in Java is actually an object, which contain methods that can perform certain operations on strings. For example, the length of a string can be found with the length() method:
          </p>
          <code>
            String txt = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
            System.out.println("The length of the txt string is: " + txt.length());
          </code>

        </article>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Java_Booleans">
        <header>Java Booleans</header>
        <article>
          <p>A boolean type is declared with the boolean keyword and can only take the values true or false:</p>
          <code>
            boolean isJavaFun = true;
            boolean isFishTasty = false;
            System.out.println(isJavaFun);     // Outputs true
            System.out.println(isFishTasty);   // Outputs false
          </code>
          <p>
            A Boolean expression returns a boolean value: true or false. This is useful to build logic, and find answers.
            For example, you can use a comparison operator, such as the greater than (>) operator, to find out if an expression (or a variable) is true or false:
          </p>
         <code>
          int x = 10;
          int y = 9;
          System.out.println(x > y); // returns true, because 10 is higher than 9
         </code>
        </article>
      </section>
      
      <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <article>
          In the example above we use two variables, x and y, to test whether x is greater than y (using the > operator). As x is 20, and y is 18, and we know that 20 is greater than 18, we print to the screen that "x is greater than y".
         
          <code>
            if (condition) {
               // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
              } else {
               // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
                  }
         </code>
         <p>Example</p>
         <code>
           int time = 20;
            if (time < 18) {
            System.out.println("Good day.");
                } else {
              System.out.println("Good evening.");
                }
                // Outputs "Good evening."
         </code>

          <p>
          In the example above, time (20) is greater than 18, so the condition is false. Because of this, we move on to the else condition and print to the screen "Good evening". If the time was less than 18, the program would print "Good day"
          </p>
          <code>
         if (condition1) {
           // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
            } else if (condition2) {
             // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is true
          } else {
             // block of code to be executed if the condition1 is false and condition2 is false
          }
          </code>
          
          <p>Example</p>

          <code>
            int time = 22;
             if (time < 10) {
                   System.out.println("Good morning.");
                    } else if (time < 18) {
                        System.out.println("Good day.");
                    } else {
                        System.out.println("Good evening.");
                      }
                  // Outputs "Good evening."

         Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is reached.
         Loops are handy because they save time, reduce errors, and they make code more readable.

          <code>
            while (condition) {
             // code block to be executed
              }
          </code> 
      In the example below, the code in the loop will run, over and over again, as long as a variable (i) is less than 5:
            <code>
              int i = 0;
                while (i < 5) {
                System.out.println(i);
                   i++;
                  }
            </code>

          <p>
           The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
          </p>
          <code>
            do {
         // code block to be executed
            }
              while (condition);
          </code>

          Example:

          <p>
            The example below uses a do/while loop. The loop will always be executed at least once, even if the condition is false, because the code block is executed before the condition is tested:          </p>

          <code>
            int i = 0;
            do {
             System.out.println(i);
                     i++;
                }
              while (i < 5);
          </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Arrays">
        <header>Arrays</header>
        <article>
         Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
          To declare an array, define the variable type with square brackets:
          <code>
            String[] cars;
          </code>
          <p>
        We have now declared a variable that holds an array of strings. To insert values to it, you can place the values in a comma-separated list, inside curly braces:
          </p>

          <code>
            String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
          </code>
          <p>
           To create an array of integers, you could write:
          </p>
          <code>
            int[] myNum = {10, 20, 30, 40};
          </code>
          <p>
        You can access an array element by referring to the index number. This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:
          </p>
          <code>
            String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
              System.out.println(cars[0]);
                // Outputs Volvo
